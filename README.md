This is my first script - its super simple, I know. But we all gotta start somewhere. Adding it to GH, to keep track of my progress and maybe even help others, starting out.

When run, the script ask for IP and then make a simple check of host availability, using a ping. 

If the host is up, it ask for Nmap flags and name of output file. If down, it writes a message to the terminal saying host is down and closing.

Feel free to do whatever you like with this script - if you are making it avialable to others, with only minor changes, I would appreciate being credited ;)
